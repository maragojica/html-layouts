								<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong> &mdash; UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR STRICT LIABILITY, WILL TOWER, OR ITS AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS, CONTENT PROVIDERS (AND THEIR LICENSEES), LICENCORS, OR SUPPLIERS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, RELIANCE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY UNSUCCESSFUL TEST, EXAM OR GRADE OR ANY MISSED DEADLINE, ANY UNSUCCESSFUL COURT ACTION OR LEGAL DISPUTE, ANY LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES RESULTING FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR NON-PECUNIARY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THAT RESULT FROM YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE MATERIALS AND CONTENT ON THE SERVICES OR ANY REFERENCE SITES, OR ANY OTHER INTERACTIONS WITH TOWER, EVEN IF TOWER, OR ANY TOWER AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE, AS APPLICABLE, HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Limitation of Damages</strong> &mdash; IN NO EVENT WILL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF TOWER OR ITS AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, PUBLISHING PARTNERS, AGENTS, OR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS, TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR PRIVACY POLICY, YOUR OR ANY USER'S USE OF ANY SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY USER CONTENT) OR YOUR INTERACTION WITH OTHER TOWER USERS (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE), EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY DOLLARS.

							</p>
							<h2 class="color-orange">9 Disputes: Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
							<p>
								<strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								 You and Tower agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
							</p>
							<p>
								 This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to your use of the services; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms). The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.
							</p>
							<p>
								 By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Tower as follows:
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Initial Dispute Resolution</strong>. Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to litigation. You can reach Tower at <a href="mailto:info@toweredtech.com">info@toweredtech.com</a>. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Tower, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms or Privacy Policy's formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, your use of the services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com ); (b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 2500 N. Military Trail, Suite 200, Boca Raton, FL 33431; and (c) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to Tower at Tower Education Technologies, Inc., 102 NE 2nd Street, Suite 916, Boca Raton, FL 33432, Attention: Legal Department.
							</p>
							<p>
								 To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Tower will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Tower will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.
							</p>
							<p>
								 The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
							</p>
							<p>
								 If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of Florida, United States of America. You and Tower further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Boca Raton, Florida in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. <strong>YOU AND TOWER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</strong>. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</strong>. Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. <strong>For avoidance of doubt, a court, and not any arbitrator or JAMS, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes brought in small claims court, and not any arbitrator or JAMS, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve disputes regarding whether a dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court</strong>.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>30-Day Right to Opt-Out</strong>. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by emailing written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="mailto:info@toweredtech.com">info@toweredtech.com</a> with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." Please include in your email the phone number you submitted to us to sign up for the services. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your use of the services; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Tower also will not be bound by them.
							</p>
							<p>
								 Survival. This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of these Terms or your use of the services.
							</p>
							<h2 class="color-orange">10 General Provisions</h2>
							<p>
								<strong>Changes</strong>. These terms are subject to change. Tower will notify of any changes to its terms by posting the new terms on this Platform. The last revision date for the terms is posted at the beginning of these terms. You are responsible for providing Tower with an up-to-date, active, and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting the Platform and the terms to check for any changes. Continued use of the Tower InspirED Platform following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes. Electronic Communications. The communications between Tower and you use electronic means, whether you use the Platform or send us emails, or we post notices on the site or communicate with you via email. For contractual purposes, you:
							</p>
							<ul type="a">
								<li>Consent to receive communications from Tower in an electronic form;</li>
								<li>Agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Tower provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in a hardcopy.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>Entire Terms</strong>. These terms constitute the entire agreement between Tower and you regarding the use of the InspirED Platform. Tower's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms shall not operate as waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these terms are for your convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word "including" means "including without limitation." If any provision of these terms is, for any reason, found to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these terms will be unimpaired, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be regarded as modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
