All provisions of this agreement that by their nature should survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, limitations of liability, and miscellaneous provisions. </p>

										<h2 class="color-orange">9	Disputes: Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>

										<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong></p>

										<p>You and Tower agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p>

										<p>This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to your use of the services; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms). The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.</p>

										<p>By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Tower as follows:</p>

										<p><strong>Initial Dispute Resolution</strong>. Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to litigation. You can reach Tower at <a href="mailto:info@toweredtech.com">info@toweredtech.com</a>. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Tower, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>

										<p><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms or Privacy Policy's formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, your use of the services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com ); (b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 2500 N. Military Trail, Suite 200, Boca Raton, FL 33431; and (c) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to Tower at Tower Education Technologies, Inc., 102 NE 2nd Street, Suite 916, Boca Raton, FL 33432, Attention: Legal Department.</p>

										<p>To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Tower will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Tower will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>

										<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>

										<p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of Florida, United States of America. You and Tower further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Boca Raton, Florida in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

										<p><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. <strong>YOU AND TOWER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</strong>. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>

										<p><strong>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</strong>. Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. <strong>For avoidance of doubt, a court, and not any arbitrator or JAMS, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes brought in small claims court, and not any arbitrator or JAMS, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve disputes regarding whether a dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court</strong>.</p>

										<p><strong>30-Day Right to Opt-Out</strong>. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by emailing written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="mailto:info@toweredtech.com">info@toweredtech.com</a> with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." Please include in your email the phone number you submitted to us to sign up for the services. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your use of the services; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Tower also will not be bound by them.</p>

										<p>Survival. This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of these Terms or your use of the services.</p>

										<h2 class="color-orange">10	General Provisions</h2>

										<p><strong>Changes</strong>. These terms are subject to change. Tower will notify of any changes to its terms by posting the new terms on this Platform. The last revision date for the terms is posted at the beginning of these terms. You are responsible for providing Tower with an up-to-date, active, and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting the Platform and the terms to check for any changes. Continued use of the Tower InspirED Platform following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
										Electronic Communications. The communications between Tower and you use electronic means, whether you use the Platform or send us emails, or we post notices on the site or communicate with you via email. For contractual purposes, you:</p>
											<ul type="a">
											    <li>Consent to receive communications from Tower in an electronic form;</li>
											    <li>Agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Tower provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in a hardcopy.</li>
											</ul>
										<p><strong>Entire Terms</strong>. These terms constitute the entire agreement between Tower and you regarding the use of the InspirED Platform. Tower's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms shall not operate as waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these terms are for your convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word "including" means "including without limitation." If any provision of these terms is, for any reason, found to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these terms will be unimpaired, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be regarded as modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. </p>

Additionally, if Tower believes it is necessary to investigate potential violations of the Terms of Service, to enforce the Terms of Service, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or act regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats against persons, property, or the systems on which we operate our Platform, then Tower will share or disclose your Personal Data.	</li>

									<h2 class="color-orange">9 Data Security, Retention, and Deletion</h2>
									<h3>9.1	Information Security</h3>
									<p>Tower is committed to protecting your information and takes thorough precautions to protect it. However, internet data transmissions cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secured. Therefore, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us including Personal Data. Given this information, you acknowledge that you transmit information at your own risk.</p>

									<p>Tower uses industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This encryption is commonly referred to as secure socket layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) technology.</p>

									<p>Once Tower receives your data, we protect it on our servers with a combination of logical, physical, and technical security safeguards. The security of the data stored locally in any of our software requires you to be responsible for ensuring the security features on the device are enabled. Tower strongly recommends you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices you use in connection with our Platform.</p>

									<p>If Tower learns of a security breach, we may attempt to notify and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address you provide us or by posting a notice on the Platform. Depending on where you live, you may have the legal right to receive such notices in writing.</p>

									<p>In some cases, we cannot control, and are not responsible for, information that is shared about you. For example:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Information You Share. The Platform may let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines or otherwise further disclosed. </li>
    									<li>Social Media Accounts. Tower maintains various social network accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or LinkedIn. Please note that comments and information that you leave in such settings are likely to be broadly visible and may not be controlled by us. We are therefore not responsible for any information or messages you leave in such settings or for how such information may be used by others. Please review the terms of use and privacy policies of any social network platforms you use, as they will control your rights and responsibilities, and your use of those platforms is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>9.2	 Data Retention</h3>

									<p>Tower retains your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention.</p>

									</ul>

									<h2 class="color-orange">11	Notice to California Residents &mdash; Your California Rights</h2>

									<p>A California resident who has provided Personal Data to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. As noted above, we do not disclose personal information to third parties for such purposes.</p>

									<h2 class="color-orange">12	How to Exercise your Rights</h2>

									<p>The above rights apply to Data Controllers (also called "businesses" under CCPA). If we are the Data Controller of your information, you can exercise those rights by Contacting Us below. Please note that when making a request, we may ask for additional information in order to verify your identity. If we are the Data Processor, you should reach out to the controller of your data, e.g., the Institution or Educators who may have collected your data.</p> 

									<p>We will process your request without undue delay and in accordance with the requirements of applicable data protection laws.  Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.</p>

									<p>You may have various other rights under data protection laws. These rights requests may be submitted in whatever format you wish, but we recommend you email <a href="mailto:info@TowerEdTech.com">info@TowerEdTech.com</a> to ensure a timely response to your request.</p>

									<p>Please note, if the data access request falls under our role as a Data Processor, we will forward the information to the Data Controller and respond to the request as directed by the Data Controller, or if there are actions we are compelled to take according to applicable laws pertaining to Data Processors, we will inform the Data Controller before taking action.</p> 

									<p>Depending on your location, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint regarding the processing of your Personal Data with us by contacting our Data Protection Officer listed above. You may also have a right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authorities in the country where you habitually reside, work, or where an infringement occurred. For residents of the European Union, you can find a list of Data Protection Authorities here. </p>

									<h2 class="color-orange">13	International Transfers</h2>

									<p>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information about you, including Personal Data, to a country and jurisdiction that may not have the same data protection laws as your country of residence. By providing us with Personal Data,  you consent to the transfer of information about you, including your Personal Data, to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including your Personal Data, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

									<p>In some cases, we may transfer Personal Data provided to us by Institutions and Educators in one country, to entities within our organization located outside of that country. If we transfer Personal Data internationally, we may rely on a legal framework that provides appropriate safeguards, which could include the standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or another framework deemed adequate by the appropriate governing body (such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission).</p>

									<h2 class="color-orange">14	Third Party Links</h2>

									<p>The Platform may contain links to webpages or tools operated by parties other than Tower. We do not control such websites or tools and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites or service providers. Our inclusion of links to an outside website or tool does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or tools or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever links you select or software you download (whether from an electronic platform (such as an app) or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which you will be subject to upon accessing the third party's website. We strongly recommend you review the third party's terms and policies.</p>

									<h2 class="color-orange">15	Children</h2>

									<p>Tower does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with information without the consent of the parent or guardian, then the parent or guardian should immediately contact Tower via e-mail or through other written communications. We will delete such information as soon as reasonably possible. If we determine on our own that we have collected Personal Data from a child younger than 13 years of age, Tower will take reasonable measures to remove that child's information from our system. We strongly encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to advise their children to never provide Personal Data through this platform without their permission.</p>

									<h2 class="color-orange">16	Do Not Track</h2>

									Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites and online services that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Such browser features and industry standards are not uniform, so our websites and online services do not respond to those signals.

									<h2 class="color-orange">17	Contact Information</h2>

									<p>If you have any specific questions about this Privacy Policy, or privacy requests, you can contact our Data Protection Officer:</p>
