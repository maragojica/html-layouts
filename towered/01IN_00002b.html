						<h2 class="color-orange">9 Data Security, Retention, and Deletion</h2>
						<h3>9.1	Information Security</h3>
						<p>Tower is committed to protecting your information and takes thorough precautions to protect it. However, internet data transmissions cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secured. Therefore, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us including Personal Data. Given this information, you acknowledge that you transmit information at your own risk.</p>

						<p>Tower uses industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This encryption is commonly referred to as secure socket layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) technology.</p>

						<p>Once Tower receives your data, we protect it on our servers with a combination of logical, physical, and technical security safeguards. The security of the data stored locally in any of our software requires you to be responsible for ensuring the security features on the device are enabled. Tower strongly recommends you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices you use in connection with our Platform.</p>

						<p>If Tower learns of a security breach, we may attempt to notify and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address you provide us or by posting a notice on the Platform. Depending on where you live, you may have the legal right to receive such notices in writing.</p>

						<p>In some cases, we cannot control, and are not responsible for, information that is shared about you. For example:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Information You Share. The Platform may let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines or otherwise further disclosed. </li>
							<li>Social Media Accounts. Tower maintains various social network accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or LinkedIn. Please note that comments and information that you leave in such settings are likely to be broadly visible and may not be controlled by us. We are therefore not responsible for any information or messages you leave in such settings or for how such information may be used by others. Please review the terms of use and privacy policies of any social network platforms you use, as they will control your rights and responsibilities, and your use of those platforms is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>9.2	 Data Retention</h3>

						<p>Tower retains your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention.</p>

						<h3>9.3	 Account Closure</h3>

						<h2 class="color-orange">10	Your Data Privacy Rights</h2>

						<p>Under certain data privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation for users in the European Union, you may have the right to:</p>

						<h2 class="color-orange">11	Notice to California Residents &mdash; Your California Rights</h2>

						<p>A California resident who has provided Personal Data to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. As noted above, we do not disclose personal information to third parties for such purposes.</p>

						<h2 class="color-orange">12	How to Exercise your Rights</h2>

						<p>The above rights apply to Data Controllers (also called "businesses" under CCPA). If we are the Data Controller of your information, you can exercise those rights by Contacting Us below. Please note that when making a request, we may ask for additional information in order to verify your identity. If we are the Data Processor, you should reach out to the controller of your data, e.g., the Institution or Educators who may have collected your data.</p> 

						<p>We will process your request without undue delay and in accordance with the requirements of applicable data protection laws.  Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.</p>

						<p>You may have various other rights under data protection laws. These rights requests may be submitted in whatever format you wish, but we recommend you email <a href="mailto:info@TowerEdTech.com">info@TowerEdTech.com</a> to ensure a timely response to your request.</p>

						<p>Please note, if the data access request falls under our role as a Data Processor, we will forward the information to the Data Controller and respond to the request as directed by the Data Controller, or if there are actions we are compelled to take according to applicable laws pertaining to Data Processors, we will inform the Data Controller before taking action.</p> 

						<p>Depending on your location, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint regarding the processing of your Personal Data with us by contacting our Data Protection Officer listed above. You may also have a right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authorities in the country where you habitually reside, work, or where an infringement occurred. For residents of the European Union, you can find a list of Data Protection Authorities here. </p>

						<h2 class="color-orange">13	International Transfers</h2>

						<p>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information about you, including Personal Data, to a country and jurisdiction that may not have the same data protection laws as your country of residence. By providing us with Personal Data,  you consent to the transfer of information about you, including your Personal Data, to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including your Personal Data, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

						<p>In some cases, we may transfer Personal Data provided to us by Institutions and Educators in one country, to entities within our organization located outside of that country. If we transfer Personal Data internationally, we may rely on a legal framework that provides appropriate safeguards, which could include the standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or another framework deemed adequate by the appropriate governing body (such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission).</p>

						<h2 class="color-orange">14	Third Party Links</h2>

						<p>The Platform may contain links to webpages or tools operated by parties other than Tower. We do not control such websites or tools and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites or service providers. Our inclusion of links to an outside website or tool does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or tools or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever links you select or software you download (whether from an electronic platform (such as an app) or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which you will be subject to upon accessing the third party's website. We strongly recommend you review the third party's terms and policies.</p>

						<h2 class="color-orange">15	Children</h2>

						<p>Tower does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with information without the consent of the parent or guardian, then the parent or guardian should immediately contact Tower via e-mail or through other written communications. We will delete such information as soon as reasonably possible. If we determine on our own that we have collected Personal Data from a child younger than 13 years of age, Tower will take reasonable measures to remove that child's information from our system. We strongly encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to advise their children to never provide Personal Data through this platform without their permission.</p>

						<h2 class="color-orange">16	Do Not Track</h2>

						Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites and online services that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Such browser features and industry standards are not uniform, so our websites and online services do not respond to those signals.

						<h2 class="color-orange">17	Contact Information</h2>

						<p>If you have any specific questions about this Privacy Policy, or privacy requests, you can contact our Data Protection Officer:</p>
